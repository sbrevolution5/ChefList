# ChefList
Cheflist is an app born out of my family's frustrations with shopping and recipes.  The main concept is threefold:
1. Making meal planning simpler.
2. Finding new recipes to enjoy.
3. Having an easy shopping list that is formed from the meals you've planned

#Tech stack
The app is written in Blazor Webassembly with a serverside api.  For the database it uses postgres/NPGSql.  I am also using MudBlazor, an excellent material design component library.
